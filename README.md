# 🐍 Snakes on the Brain 🧠

> Alright, listen up. This ain't your grandma's Snake game. This is a dark, twisted version straight out of a post-apocalyptic nightmare. I’m Snake Plissken, and I've been through hell and back. But now, I’m half-man, half-snake, and I’m hungry. Real hungry. Your mission, if you’ve got the guts, is to navigate this wasteland and help me devour as many brains as possible. Every move counts, and one wrong turn means game over. Think you’ve got what it takes to control me? Let’s find out. Remember, I've been in tougher spots than this. It's survival of the fittest out here, and I need your help to come out on top. Let's get this done.
